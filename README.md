A 3D-printable under-desk mount with adjustable tilt for an ESP32 2.8" ILI9341 touchscreen, powered by ESPHome + LVGL and integrated with Home Assistant.  
Includes ready-to-flash YAML configs for the ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display) and a standalone ILI9341 + external ESP32 wiring variant.
The enclosure is optimized for under-desk mounting but can also be used as a compact Home Assistant wall panel or desktop dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ESP32-2432S028 Cheap Yellow Display is transformed into a tiltable under-desk Home Assistant control panel powered by ESPHome and LVGL.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, wall- or desk-mounted smart control panel that integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant.  
It features a modern LVGL-based UI, real-time state synchronization, and optional direct Home Assistant service calls.

The enclosure is designed for:

- Clean cable routing  
- Adjustable viewing angle (±35° tilt)  
- Minimal footprint  
- Professional, integrated appearance  

Two hardware variants are supported:

- ✅ **ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD)**
- ✅ **Standalone ILI9341 + External ESP32 wiring variant**

The ESP32-2432S028 integrates the ESP32, ILI9341 display, touchscreen controller, and backlight circuitry on a single board.  
It is commonly known as the **Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)** in the maker community and is the easiest option for this project.

# 🆕 Architecture Overview (LVGL-Based UI)

This project uses ESPHome LVGL instead of a classic display lambda approach.

### Core Concepts

- UI rendered fully using LVGL widgets
- 4 configurable touch buttons
- Real-time state mirroring from Home Assistant
- Central `ui_refresh` script keeps UI synchronized
- Optional direct Home Assistant service calls
- Action sensor for automation-based control

### Two Control Modes

#### 1️⃣ Direct Mode (Default – Plug & Play)

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"true"` (default):

- Touch publishes an action string
- AND directly calls a Home Assistant service  
  (default: `light.toggle`)

No Home Assistant automations required.

#### 2️⃣ Automation Mode

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"false"`:

- Touch ONLY publishes an action string
- You implement behavior in Home Assistant automations

Trigger example:
```
Entity: sensor.smartdisplay_action
To: btn1_press
```


# ⚙️ Requirements

- Home Assistant installed
- ESPHome Add-on installed
- ESPHome 2026.2+
- Home Assistant 2026.2+
- Basic ESPHome knowledge
- 3D printer access (optional)

---

# 🧪 Tested With

This project was tested using:

- **ESPHome 2026.2+**
- **Home Assistant 2026.2+**
- ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD)
- ILI9341 + XPT2046 standalone wiring variant

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT -- Enable "Actions" in Home Assistant

Because this project uses:

homeassistant.action → light.toggle

You must allow the ESPHome device to perform Home Assistant service calls.

### How to enable:

1. Open Home Assistant  
2. Go to **Settings**  
3. Click **Devices & Services**  
4. Open the **ESPHome integration**  
5. Select your device  
6. Enable:

> "Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions"

Without this setting, direct control will not work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🚀 Installation

1.  Open ESPHome in Home Assistant
2.  Create a new device
3.  Copy the appropriate YAML file
4.  Edit the **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section at the top of the YAML (entities, labels, icons)
5.  Adjust WiFi credentials
6.  Flash the device

Available YAML variants:

-   esp32-2432s028.yml. (Cheap Yellow Display)
-   ili9341-with-external-esp.yml (external ESP32 + display)

Choose the one matching your hardware.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ⚙️ Button Mapping (USER CONFIG)

Both YAML variants include a **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section at the top of the file.
This is the intended place to customize the 4 buttons without touching the LVGL layout.

You can change per button:

- Entity ID (e.g. `light.kitchen`)
- Label text (caption under the icon)
- Icon code (MDI glyph)

⚠️ **Default action:** All buttons currently call `homeassistant.action -> light.toggle`.  
If you want a different service (e.g. `switch.toggle`, `scene.turn_on`, `script.turn_on`, etc.),
you must edit the `homeassistant.action` block inside each button.

💡 If you change the icon glyph, also update the **MDI font glyph list** in the YAML
so ESPHome includes the new icon in the font.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 System Flow

### Direct Mode

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant service called  
4. Entity state updated  
5. Mirrored back into ESPHome  
6. UI refreshed  

### Automation Mode

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant automation triggers  
4. Automation controls device  
5. State mirrored back  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔧 Customization

For most setups, you only need to edit the **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section in the YAML.

You can also:

-   Add more buttons / pages
-   Change service calls (the default is `light.toggle`)
-   Modify fonts and icon glyphs
-   Adjust colors / theme
-   Change date language
-   Adjust transforms for your panel

If touch alignment is wrong, ensure `display.transform` and `touchscreen.transform`
are **identical** (they must always match).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🖨 3D Printing

See the `/3d_print` folder for STL files and Fusion 360 source files for the adjustable under-desk tilt mount.

Designed for:

-   Under-desk mounting
-   Wall mounting
-   Adjustable viewing angle
-   Hidden cable routing

This awesome project takes the same 2.8" ILI9341 touchscreen setup and repurposes it—not for lights, but for controlling a height-adjustable Flexispot desk with ease. If you're into smart home automation and custom builds, it's definitely worth a look!
